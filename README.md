**Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?**
Atemis Financial is a financial services provider, whohas clients all around the world. They engaged my company, Global Rain, to help modernize its operations and add layers of security to it.

**What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?**
I think I did a good job identifying the vulnerabilities and reporting them. It is important to code securely because it helps to keep unauthorized people from tampering with the code or the data it handles. Software security adds a ton of value to a company's overall well-being, but I think the most significant thing it adds it trust between the company and it's clients.

**Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?**
Trying to figure out how to mitigate the vulnerabilities was challenging for me. I'm still not totally sure that updating is the fix for everything, but that was pretty much the answer I found.

**How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?**
I increased security by identifying vulnerabilities, adding a certificate to the application, and writing concise and secure code. In the future, I would likely run a scan using Maven, or whatever program my company uses, and I'll decide which mitigation techniques to use based on what my goals are.

**How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?**
I made sure my code was funtional through testing and observing it run perfectly with no errors. After refactoring, I simply ran another vulnerability check to see if any new vulnerabilities were introduced.

**What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?**
There were a low of resources, tools, and coding practices that I used, which will be helpful in future assignments. Some of the more significant are Maven, Eclipse, and Web forums (Such as stack overflow).

**Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?**
I might show them how I can create certificates and implement SHA-256 to use an encrypted hash function. I would also demostrate my knowledge of encryption ciphers, such as AES.
